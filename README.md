## ðŸš€ Getting Started
The goal of this project, is to create a portfolio and content site, which is easily customisable for any specific use case.
At this moment, the goal is beign achieved by controlling the app data through one static file [Ref Here](https://github.com/raph941/portfolio/blob/1a0739a8d80ff948482f86e9462e3dad3a9f2300/data/userData.ts), which contains a JSON of users'meta data.
